# Animation-of-Covid-Vaccination-Progress-in-the-US
## 1. Description
As the situation of the Covid-19 pandemic in the US is gradually getting better with the progress of the vaccination, it would be of great interest to visualize and animate exactly how the vaccination has been proceeding in the US, using a dynamic spatio-temporal map built in a web app. This web app aims to explore the progress of the Covid-19 vaccination in the United States with animations of several related variables using relevant animation modules from ArcGIS API for JavaScript (ArcGIS JS API), which can help government leaders and officials in the health care sector to make more timely and reasonable decisions.
